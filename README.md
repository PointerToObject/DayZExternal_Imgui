# DayZ simple imgui external
What's up guys. I made this simple external but with a lot of help from a friend of mine. I've been relearning C++ and basic reverse engineering since 2/26/2024, and I've been motivated since to learn how to create game hacks. My end goal is to create a youtube channel, so I can teach C++ and game hacking, so everyone wont have to go and ask 40399288 questions on 35 different servers just to get muted or kicked or all that bs. anyways let me get onto this cheat.

Extremely simple external that I will be updating frequently. 


How To Use

         : ESP        ( esp on zombies, players, cars )
         : Entity Table View (Shows all entites on the near/far table and sorts them from player to zombie from the rtti, also shows position)
         : Bullet Table View(Shows all bullet entites on the bullet table, displays position too)
         : Local Player position (as is)
